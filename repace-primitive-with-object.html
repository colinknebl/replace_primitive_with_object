        # Replace Primitive With Object

        #### A Refactoring by Martin Fowler and Kent Beck

        ---

        ### Goal

        The goal is to refactor a "concept" that is represented by a primitive value
        (in this case a string) into an object.

        ```ts
        orders.filter(order => order.priority === 'high' ||
                                order.priority === 'rush');
        ```

        <span class="arrow center">&#8681;</span>

        ```ts
        orders.filter(order => 
            order.priority.higherThan(new Priority('high'))
        );
        ```
        ???

        At the top, the order `priority` is represented here by a `string`.

        The goal is to refactor the concept of order priority from a string to an object.

        As you can see in the second example, using the `Priority` class allows 
        the code to be very expressive.

        In some circumstances, using a primitive data type might be perfectly acceptable. 

        However, I would argue as software matures it rarely ever turns out to be 
        the right choice. 

        ---

        ### Refactoring Steps

        1. Apply Encapsulate Variable if it isn't already
        2. Create a simple value class for the data value. It should take the existing value in its constructor and provide a getter for that value.
        3. Run static checks
        4. Change the setter to create a new instance of the value class and store that in the field, changing the type of the field if present.
        5. Change the getter to return the result of invoking the getter of the new class.
        6. Test.
        7. Consider using Rename Function on the original accessors to better reflect what they do.

        ### Steps

        - Apply Encapsulate Variable
        ]

        .right-column[

        This is refering to creating an `Order` class if it isn't already.

        ```ts
        class Order {
            get priority(): string {
                return this.#priority;
            }

            set priority(priority: string) {
                this.#priority = priority;
            }
        }
        ```

        ]

        ???

        2. Create a simple value class for the data value. It should take the existing value in its constructor and provide a getter for that value.
        3. Run static checks
        4. Change the setter to create a new instance of the value class and store that in the field, changing the type of the field if present.

                this.#value = value;
            }

            public toString(): string {
                return this.#value;
            }
        }

        7. Consider using Rename Function on the original accessors to better reflect what they do.

        The `toString` method could alternatively be a getter 

        ```ts
        class Priority {
            // ...snip
            public get value(): string {
                return this.#value;
            }
        }
        ```

        .right-column[

        The `priority` setter we initially set up for the `Order` class now needs to be updated.

        ```ts
        class Order {

            set priority(priority: string) {
                this.#priority =

        This is an optional step.

                return this.#priority.toString();
            }

            get priority(): Priority {
                return this.#priority;
            }
        }
        ```

        ### 7. Consider using Rename Function on the original accessors to better reflect what they do.

        We may also want to provide a getter for direct access to the priority object.

        ## Additional functionality

        ```ts
        class Priority {
            private static _validValues = 
                new Set(['low', 'normal', 'high', 'rush']);

            public constructor(value: string) {
                if (!Priority._validValues.has(value)) {
                    throw new Error(`${value} is an invalid Priority!`);
                }
                this.#value = value;
            }

            public toString(): string {
                return this.#value;
            }

            // ... snip
        }
        ```
        ???

        The `Priority` class now gives us a single place to encapsulate logic 
        associated to priorities.

        ---

        ## Additional functionality

        ```ts
        class Priority {
            // ... snip

            private get _priorityLevel(): number {
                return Array.from(Priority._validValues.values())
                    .indexOf(this.#value);
            }

            public isEqual(other: Priority): boolean {
                return this.#value === other.#value;
            }

            public higherThan(other: Priority): boolean {
                return this._priorityLevel > other._priorityLevel;
            }

            public lessThan(other: Priority): boolean {
                return this._priorityLevel < other._priorityLevel;
            }
        }
        ```

        ???

        Consider what this logic would look like if the priority was still represented by a string

        It would be hard to read, difficult to maintain, and prone to bugs. 

        ---

        ### Example in IdealSpaces

        ```ts
        AE.provisional.design.getSelectedItems();
        [{
            // ...snip
            BBoxMax: "32000 0 67200",
            Pos: "-15520 140000 8000"
        }]
        ```

        Here the Bounding Box and Position are represented by strings. In order to work with these values
        you have to parse it first.

        ???

        Parsing the string itself is simple, but it opens the software up to many potential bugs.

        What if you use the first value as the 'z' value instead of the 'x' value?

        What if you incorrectly get the screen position based on the parsed values?

        If the Bounding Box was represented here with an object, it could have all the required behavior
        easily accessible without having to re-write the needed functionality. 
        ---

        ### The Refactor Result

        ```ts
        class BoundingBox {
        *   public static initFromString(bb: string): BoundingBox {}
            public constructor(bb: { x: number, y: number, z: number }) {}
        }
        const boundingBox1 = new BoundingBox({ x: 32000, y: 0, z: 67200 });
        // or
        const boundingBox2 = BoundingBox.initFromString("32000 0 67200");
        ```

        The BoundingBox object gives you a single place to encapsulate all logic
        associated to the Bounding Box. 

        ---

        ### Summary

        In some circumstances, using a primitive data type might be perfectly acceptable. 

        However, I would argue as software matures it rarely ever turns out to be 
        the right choice.
